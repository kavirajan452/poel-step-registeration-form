## 1. Enhanced Toast Alerts with Field Names

### Description
Toast alert messages now include the specific field name that requires attention, making it easier for users to identify which field needs correction.

### Examples of Enhanced Messages

**Previous:**
- "File size must not exceed 2MB"
- "Please select at least one Vendor Type"

**Enhanced:**
- "Company Registration File: File size must not exceed 2MB"
- "Vendor Type: Please select at least one option"
- "GST Registration: Please select Yes or No"
- "E-Invoice Applicability: Please select an option"

### Implementation Details
- File upload validation now captures the field label from the closest `.vrf-row` parent
- Radio and checkbox validation includes field-specific messaging
- Format validation errors remain as before (shown inline below the field)

### User Benefits
- Immediately know which field has an issue
- Faster form completion
- Reduced confusion, especially for file upload errors

---

## 2. Visual Highlighting for Required Radio Buttons and Checkboxes

### Description
Required radio button and checkbox groups that are not filled now display a distinct visual indicator (red border and light background).

### Visual Indicators
- **Red left border** (3px solid #ef2927)
- **Light red background** (rgba(239, 41, 39, 0.03))
- **Red label text** with increased font weight
- Automatically removed when user selects an option

### Affected Fields
- **Step 1:** Vendor Type checkboxes
- **Step 2:** GST Registration radio buttons
- **Step 2:** E-Invoice Applicability radio buttons (when GST=Yes)
- **Step 2:** Return Filing Frequency radio buttons (when GST=Yes)
- **Step 3:** MSME Registration radio buttons

### CSS Classes
```css
.vrf-row.vrf-field-required {
    border-left: 3px solid #ef2927;
    padding-left: 10px;
    background: rgba(239, 41, 39, 0.03);
}

.vrf-row.vrf-field-required > label:first-child {
    color: #ef2927;
    font-weight: 500;
}
```

### JavaScript Behavior
- Highlighting applied when validation fails
- Automatically removed when user selects any option in the group
- Works on both "Next" button click and final form submission

### User Benefits
- Clear visual feedback for required selections
- Consistent with text input validation styling
- Easy to spot which radio/checkbox groups need attention

## 4. Improved Navigation to First Missing Field

### Description
Enhanced navigation logic to jump to the first field (or radio/checkbox group) that requires attention.

### Behavior

### Navigation Priority
1. First text input/select with `.vrf-invalid` class

## Security Considerations

### Email Security
- All data is sanitized before including in emails
- User email addresses are validated with `is_email()`
- HTML emails use `esc_html()` for all dynamic content
- File attachments are validated server-side

### Data Handling
- No sensitive data exposed in client-side JavaScript
- Email sending happens after successful database storage
- Failed emails don't prevent registration from being saved

### Spam Prevention
- Emails sent only after nonce verification
- Rate limiting handled by WordPress
- Consider adding reCAPTCHA for production use

---

## Performance Impact

### Client-Side
- Minimal: ~50 lines of additional JavaScript
- No external libraries added
- No performance degradation in form validation

### Server-Side
- Email sending adds ~1-2 seconds to submission
- Runs asynchronously (doesn't block response to user)
- File attachments may increase server load (typical: 2-10MB total)

### Optimization Tips
- Consider using email queue plugin for high-volume sites
- Use SMTP for faster email delivery
- Compress uploaded files if possible

---

## Future Enhancement Possibilities

1. **Email Templates Customization**
   - Admin UI to customize email templates
   - Support for multiple languages
   - Add logo upload feature

2. **Email Delivery Reports**
   - Track email open rates
   - Delivery confirmation
   - Bounce handling

3. **Additional Recipients**
   - CC/BCC options
   - Department-specific routing
   - Multiple admin emails

4. **Email Queuing**
   - Background job processing
   - Retry failed emails
   - Scheduled sending

5. **SMS Notifications**
   - Send SMS to user
   - Admin SMS alerts
   - Integration with SMS gateways

---

## Support and Maintenance

### Common Issues

**Emails not sending:**
1. Check WordPress admin email in Settings > General
2. Verify server mail configuration
3. Check spam/junk folders
4. Install WP Mail SMTP plugin
5. Check error logs: `/wp-content/debug.log`

**Emails going to spam:**
1. Configure SPF/DKIM records
2. Use authenticated SMTP
3. Verify sender domain
4. Use email service like SendGrid or Mailgun

**File attachments too large:**
1. Check server `upload_max_filesize` setting
2. Check email server limits (typically 25MB)
3. Consider using file links instead of attachments

**Radio/checkbox highlighting not showing:**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check CSS file loaded correctly
3. Verify jQuery is available
4. Check browser console for errors

### Debug Mode

To enable email debugging:
```php
// Add to wp-config.php
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
```

Check logs at: `/wp-content/debug.log`
