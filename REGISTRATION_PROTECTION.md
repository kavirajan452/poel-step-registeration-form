# Registration Protection

This document explains the protection mechanisms implemented for registration post types.

## Overview

To maintain data integrity and prevent accidental modifications, the plugin implements protection mechanisms that prevent editing and deletion of registration entries.

## Protection Features

### 1. Edit Protection

**What it does:**
- Prevents administrators from editing registration entries after submission
- Removes the "Edit" link from the registrations list
- Disables the edit capability for registrations post type

**Why it's needed:**
- Preserves the original submission data
- Prevents accidental modifications
- Maintains audit trail integrity
- Ensures data authenticity

### 2. Trash Protection

**What it does:**
- Prevents administrators from moving registrations to trash
- Removes the "Trash" link from the registrations list
- Disables the delete capability for registrations post type

**Why it's needed:**
- Prevents accidental deletion of important submissions
- Ensures data retention for compliance
- Maintains complete registration history

## Viewing Registrations

While editing and deletion are disabled, administrators can still:
- **View** all registration details in the admin list
- **Access** individual registration entries (read-only)
- **Export** registration data using the Export feature
- **Download** attached files from registrations
- **Filter** registrations by form type
- **Search** through registrations

## Technical Implementation

### Capability Filtering

The plugin uses WordPress's `user_has_cap` filter to remove edit and delete capabilities specifically for the registrations post type:

```php
public function remove_edit_trash_capabilities( $allcaps, $caps, $args )
```

This ensures that even administrators cannot edit or delete registrations through the WordPress admin interface.

### Row Actions Removal

The plugin removes edit and trash action links from the registration list using the `post_row_actions` filter:

```php
public function remove_row_actions( $actions, $post )
```

This provides a clean interface that prevents confusion about what actions are available.

## Security Considerations

### Why These Protections Matter

1. **Data Integrity**: Submitted registration data should remain unchanged to ensure authenticity
2. **Compliance**: Many industries require immutable records of submissions
3. **Audit Trail**: Original submissions serve as legal documentation
4. **Accidental Deletion**: Prevents costly mistakes from accidental deletion

### What Admins Can Still Do

Administrators retain full control over other aspects:
- View all registration data
- Export data in multiple formats
- Configure email settings
- Manage other WordPress content
- Access uploaded files

## Data Management

### How to Handle Incorrect Submissions

If a registration contains errors:
1. **Contact the submitter** to resubmit with correct information
2. **Export the data** for offline correction and tracking
3. **Note the discrepancy** in internal records
4. **Do not modify** the original submission

### Data Retention

Since registrations cannot be deleted through the admin interface:
- Plan for long-term data retention
- Consider implementing a data archival process
- Ensure adequate database capacity
- Regular backups are essential

### Database-Level Access

If deletion is absolutely necessary:
- Direct database access is required
- Only database administrators should perform this
- Ensure proper backups before any database operations
- Document all deletions for audit purposes

## Exceptions and Customization

The protection is implemented at the WordPress capability level, which means:
- It applies to all user roles
- It cannot be bypassed through the admin interface
- Direct database access can still modify or delete records
- Developers can temporarily disable protection by modifying the plugin code

## Best Practices

1. **Train staff** on the read-only nature of registrations
2. **Implement verification** processes for new submissions
3. **Regular exports** for backup and analysis
4. **Document procedures** for handling incorrect submissions
5. **Monitor submissions** closely to catch errors early

## FAQ

**Q: Can I edit a registration if there's a mistake?**
A: No, registrations are intentionally read-only. Ask the submitter to resubmit with correct information.

**Q: What if I need to delete a registration?**
A: Registrations are protected from deletion. If absolutely necessary, direct database access is required.

**Q: Can I export and re-import corrected data?**
A: While you can export data, there's no import feature. This is by design to maintain data integrity.

**Q: Why can't I see the Edit button?**
A: This is intentional. The protection feature removes edit links to prevent modifications.

**Q: Does this affect other post types?**
A: No, these protections only apply to the 'registrations' post type. Other WordPress content remains fully editable.
